# Overview

Files to generate inputs, train, and make inferences for nodes directed graph representing a social network.

# Dependencies

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Generating inputs

1. Navigate to `data` directory
2. Make sure that clean_network_xx files are in `data` directory for the false spreader and refutation spreaders
3. Run `python local_trust.py` to generate local trust data in json
4. Run `python gen_train.py` to generate training and inference inputs for the model (make sure to look at the file and assign appropriate values for the input networks, and to select whether to generate global trust data (this can be ommited if done before))
 
NOTE: I used global file paths in some files like gen_train.py, the file paths should be updated to match your file system. Also, make sure that the output file paths match the folder structure here, to make sure that the training script can correctly source the inputs.

NOTE2: all other files in data directory are helper files that I left in. They are not necessary for generating inputs.

NOTE3: set TSM parameters in `tsm_local.py`. They are currently set to the parameters in the paper

# Training and Inference

1. navigate to training directory
2. run `python train.py n2_train timestamp_folder --epochs 1` with desired number of epochs

Replace `n2_train` with folder of inputs
Replace `1` with the desired number of epochs
Reference `train.py` to set other hyperparameters
